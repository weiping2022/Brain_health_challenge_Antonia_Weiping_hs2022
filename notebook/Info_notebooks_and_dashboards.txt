Notebooks: 
    1: data preprocessing and data wrangling. 
    
        notebook name: 1_datawrangling_final.ipynb
        
    
    
    2: modeling using sleep attributes to predict diagnosis changes (from previous visit to the current visit)
    
        notebook name: 2_model_sleep_vs_DX_conversion_final.ipynb
        
    3: based on the four most important sleep-features selected in notebook_2, visualizing the distribution of sleep features on age, education, and gender
        notebook name: 3_visualization_sleep_vs_age_gender_edu.ipynb
      
    4: similar to the notebook_2, modeling using relative brain volumes to predict diagnosis changes (from previous visit to the current visit)
    
        notebook name: 4_model_relatv_brain_volume_vs_DX_conversion_final.ipynb
        
    5: Machine Learning using sleep and brainvolume (as well as some other models not used for the paper)

Dashboards:

    1: dashboard_one.py
        include four functions used in data preprocessing and wrangling
        - key_in_str(key_list,str)
        - new_col_with_key(df,key_list,new_col)
        - drop_char(df,col)
        - char_float_na(df,col)
    2: dashboard_two.py
        include five functions for data preparation and data modeling using undersampling
        - usampling_split_scale_data(): is not used in final notebooks
        - models(): is not used in final notebooks
        - usampling_scale_data(): mainly used in notebook 2 and notebook 4
        - cv_models(): mainly used in notebook 2 and notebook 4
        - feature_importance(): mainly used in notebook 2 and notebook 4
        
    3. dashboard_three.py
        include two functions for data preparation and data modeling using oversampling
        - oversampling_split_scale_data(df,drop_lst,target)
        - models_os(df,drop_lst,target)
        The two function are not used in the final notebooks.
