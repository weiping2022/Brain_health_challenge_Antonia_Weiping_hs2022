        	- 3_model_sleep_vs_DX_conversion_final.ipynb       
     	based on the four most important sleep-features selected in notebook_3, visualizing the distribution of sleep features on age, education, and gender
        	- 3a_visualization_sleep_vs_age_gender_edu.ipynb     
    D: similar to the notebook_3, modeling using relative brain volumes to predict diagnosis changes (from previous visit to the current visit)

    G: folder 'playground' includes many different visualization and machine learning modeling tries which are not included in the final work:
		- brain volumes and biomarkers --> insomnia (classification algorithms)
		- brain volumes and biomarkers --> ventricles (linear regression)
		- KMeans clustering of brain volumes and biomarkers
		- use brain volume reduction per year --> AD conversion
		- use the changes from baseline diagnosis to the current diagnosis as target
		- use the changes from baseline diagnosis to the last diagnosis as target
       
Dashboards:
    1: dashboard_one.py
        include four functions used in data preprocessing and wrangling
        	- key_in_str(key_list,str)
        	- new_col_with_key(df,key_list,new_col)
        	- drop_char(df,col)
        	- char_float_na(df,col)
    2: dashboard_two.py
        include five functions for data preparation and data modeling using undersampling
        	- usampling_split_scale_data(): is not used in final notebooks
        	- models(): is not used in final notebooks
        	- usampling_scale_data(): mainly used in notebook 2 and notebook 4
        	- cv_models(): mainly used in notebook 2 and notebook 4
        	- feature_importance(): mainly used in notebook 2 and notebook 4
        
    3. dashboard_three.py
        include two functions for data preparation and data modeling using oversampling
        	- oversampling_split_scale_data(df,drop_lst,target)
        	- models_os(df,drop_lst,target)
            The two function are not used in the final notebooks.
